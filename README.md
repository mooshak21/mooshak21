## My background
My name is Mihir Gokhale and I am a prospective data scientist/analyst. In my previous roles, I acquired project management skills by leading a software testing team to create test plans and coordinating with my team to reach deadlines as necessary. This will most definitely help me in my future positions. My most relevant experience has come from my recent certificate in Data Science and Visualization from Rutgers University. I have gained experience doing a variety of projects in SQL, Python, and Tableau along with Machine Learning to find a meaning with the data. My visualization skills allow me to convey data that can provide non-technical people with a way of using the data for whatever business need is required. Whether it be a dashboard that shows results over a period of time or projections of future results, my skills can be used to help business teams decide on where to focus their efforts. Data science is an interdisciplinary field about processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured. This encompasses data science fields such as visualization, machine learning, data mining, and predictive analytics. I have a passion for new technologies and research so I am motivated to grow as a Data Analyst and why I see this career path as a perfect match for me.
